      <h1> Who invented computers? </h1> <br>
    <p>
      The earliest computing devices focused on making calculations easier and quicker. The abacus, which is a counting board with beads or discs that can be moved to track numbers, is an early predecessor to the modern computer. The abacus has been used for calculations since 1100 BC. An abacus is a portable counting device that was used to keep tallies for merchants who need to manage their inventory of traded goods. 
      Technology continued to progress when the circular and rectangular slide rules were invented by mathematician William Oughtred in 1632 and 1620, respectively. The slide rule built on the invention of logarithms by John Napier and helped make performing calculations easier. <br> <br>

      <b> Charles Babbage </b> <br> <br>


      While these technologies were important in the development of computers, when considering who invented computers, it is essential to learn about Charles Babbage. Starting in 1830, Babbage, an English mathematician, began designing an analytical engine that could be programmed to perform calculations using punched cards. Babbage is sometimes considered the father of computers since most computers today use basic ideas that he pioneered.

  <h1>  History of Computer </h1>
  <h2> Computers in the 1800s </h2>

<p> <b> 1801: </b> In France, weaver and merchant Joseph Marie Jacquard creates a loom that uses wooden punch cards to automate the design of woven fabrics. Early computers would use similar punch cards. </p>

<p> <b>1822:</b>  Thanks to funding from the English government, mathematician Charles Babbage invents a steam-driven calculating machine that was able to compute tables of numbers. </p>

<p> <b> 1890:</b> Inventor Herman Hollerith designs the punch card system to calculate the 1880 U.S. census. It took him three years to create, and it saved the government $5 million. He would eventually go on to establish a company that would become IBM. </p>

<div class="myDiv">
  <h2 class="years"> Computers from the 1900-1950s </h2>

<p> <b> 1936: </b>Alan Turing developed an idea for a universal machine, which he would call the Turing machine, that would be able to compute anything that is computable. The concept of modern computers was based on his idea. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\Turning Machine 1936.jpg">

<p> <b> 1937:</b> A professor of physics and mathematics at Iowa State University, J.V. Atanasoff, attempts to build the first computer without cams, belts, gears, or shafts. </p>

<p> <b> 1939:</b> Bill Hewlett and David Packard found Hewlett-Packard in a garage in Palo Alto, California. Their first project, the HP 200A Audio Oscillator, would rapidly become a popular piece of test equipment for engineers. In fact, Walt Disney Pictures would order eight to test recording equipment and speaker systems for 12 specially equipped theaters that showed Fantasia in 1940. Also in 1939, Bell Telephone Laboratories completes The Complex Number Calculator, designed by George Stibitz. </p>

<p> <b> 1941:</b> Professor of physics and mathematics at Iowa State University J.V. Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry design a computer that can solve 29 equations simultaneously. This is the first time a computer is able to house data within its own memory. </p>

<p>That same year, German engineer Konrad Zuse creates the Z3 computer, which used 2,300 relays, performed floating-point binary arithmetic, and had a 22-bit word length. This computer was eventually destroyed in a bombing raid in Berlin in 1943. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\Z3 computer.jpg">

<p> Additionally in <b>1941</b>, Alan Turing and Harold Keen built the British Bombe, which decrypted Nazi ENIGMA-based military communications during World War II. </p>

<p> <b> 1943:</b> John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, professors at the University of Pennsylvania, build an Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC). This is considered to be the grandfather of digital computers, as it is made up of 18,000 vacuum tubes and fills up a 20-foot by 40-foot room. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\Eniac.jpg">

<p>Also in <b>1943</b>, the U.S. Army asked that Bell Laboratories design a machine to assist in the testing of their M-9 director, which was a type of computer that aims large guns to their targets. George Stibitz recommended a delay-based calculator for the project. This resulted in the Relay Interpolator, which was later known as the Bell Labs Model II. </p>

<p> <b>1944:</b> British engineer Tommy Flowers designed the Colossus, which was created to break the complex code used by the Nazis in World War II. A total of ten were delivered, each using roughly 2,500 vacuum tubes. These machines would reduce the time it took to break their code from weeks to hours, leading historians to believe they greatly shortened the war by being able to understand the intentions and beliefs of the Nazis. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\Colossus.jpg">

<p> That same year, Harvard physics professor Howard Aiken built and designed The Harvard Mark 1, a room-sized, relay-based calculator.</p>

<p> <b> 1945:</b> Mathematician John von Neumann writes The First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. This paper broke down the architecture of a stored-program computer. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\Edvac.jpg">

<p> <b> 1946:</b> Mauchly and Eckert left the University of Pennsylvania and obtained funding from the Census Bureau to build the UNIVAC. This would become the first commercial computer for business and government use. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\Univac.jpg">

<p>That same year, Will F. Jenkins published the science fiction short story A Logic Named Joe, which detailed a world where computers, called Logics, interconnect into a worldwide network. When a Logic malfunctions, it gives out secret information about forbidden topics. </p>

<p> <b> 1948:</b> Frederick Williams, Geoff Toothill, and Tom Kilburn, researchers at the University of Manchester, develop the Small-Scale Experimental Machine. This was built to test new memory technology, which became the first high-speed electronic random access memory for computers. The became the first program to run on a digital, electronic, stored-program computer. </p>

<p> <b> 1950:</b> Built in Washington, DC, the Standards Eastern Automatic Computer (SEAC) was created, becoming the first stored program computer completed in the United States. It was a test-bed for evaluating components and systems, in addition to setting computer standards. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\Easter Automatic Computer.jpg">

<p> <b> 1953: </b>Computer scientist Grace Hopper develops the first computer language, which is eventually known as COBOL, that allowed a computer user to use English-like words instead of numbers to give the computer instructions. In 1997, a study showed that over 200 billion lines of COBOL code were still in existence. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\Grace_Hopper.jpg">

<p>That same year, business man Thomas Johnson Watson Jr. creates the IBM 701 EDPM, which is used to help the United Nations keep tabs on Korea during the war. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\IBM 701 EDPM.jpg">

<p> <b> 1954:</b> The FORTRAN programming language is developed by John Backus and a team of programmers at IBM. Additionally, IBM creates the 650, which was the first mass-produced computer, selling 450 in just one year. </p>

<p> <b> 1958:</b> Jack Kirby and Robert Noyce invented the integrated circuit, which is what we now call the computer chip. Kilby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for his work.</p>

<p> <b> 1982: </b> Instead of going with its annual tradition of naming a “Man of the Year”, Time Magazine does something a little different and names the computer its “Machine of the Year”. A senior writer noted in the article, “Computers were once regarded as distant, ominous abstractions, like Big Brother. In 1982, they truly became personalized, brought down to scale, so that people could hold, prod and play with them." </p>

<img src="C:\Users\ACER\Desktop\Chronicas de Informatica\machine of the year.jpg">

<p> <b> 1983: </b> The CD-ROM hit the market, able to hold 550 megabytes of pre-recorded data. That same year, many computer companies worked to set a standard for these disks, making them able to be used freely to access a wide variety of information. </p>
